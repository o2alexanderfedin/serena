# /o2-scalpel-python-dashboard

Open the dashboard for the **`scalpel-python`** MCP server (the o2-scalpel-python plugin's engine instance). Discovery: `pgrep -f "scalpel-python"` cross-referenced against `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` to resolve the port.

The engine binds the dashboard **lazily** — until the agent makes its first `scalpel_*` tool call against the python server, no port is bound. If discovery says "not yet bound", invoke any python facade (e.g. `scalpel_workspace_health`) and re-run.
