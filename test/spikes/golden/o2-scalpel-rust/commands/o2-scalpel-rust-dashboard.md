# /o2-scalpel-rust-dashboard

Open the dashboard for the **`scalpel-rust`** MCP server (the o2-scalpel-rust plugin's engine instance). Discovery: `pgrep -f "scalpel-rust"` cross-referenced against `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` to resolve the port.

The engine binds the dashboard **lazily** — until the agent makes its first Scalpel tool call against the rust server, no port is bound. If discovery says "not yet bound", invoke any rust facade (e.g. `workspace_health`) and re-run.
